Added [general/link.html]

I decided to create a links page...;
but, as yet I remain undecided if I should...
have just 1 long 'links' page: links.html;
or else, divide the page up into being a series of individual web pages, instead.

So,...
links.html > computing.html > programming.html > vbscript.html
links.html > computing.html > operating-systems.html > windows.html > windows10Pro.html
-etc.
