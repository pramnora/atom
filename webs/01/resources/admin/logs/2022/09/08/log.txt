FOREWORD

This is the very 1st log file...relating to this web site creation process.

These logs are used to indicate the state of my mind when building this web site;
a mindset which tends to change every now and then...going either this way/or, that, rather unpredictably...?

-----

Started creating this web site very early during this morning.

It will be a diary/blog type of site.

My intention is to create a clickable calender...; that links to each data entry when the date is 'clicked' on.

There are 2 ways this can be achieved...

-----

1> Have one long file...that scrolls downwards...where each data entry is shown...with a menu at the top...that selects each data entry.

This 1st method would create an extra long page...with entries not only for 2022/but, 2023/extending further on downwards.../-etc.

-----

2> Have a div output section; together with a Javascript database...; so, that when an entry is clicked on...; it loads in the data entry
from the database...and, displays it inside of the div output section.

...the 2nd method would create a much less long page.

However, if the end user has their Javascript turned off...; then, they wouldn't actually be able to see anything...?!


-----

3> Yet, another possiblity is to use this web page design to build a calender section;
with other web pages linking to other subjects, instead.
