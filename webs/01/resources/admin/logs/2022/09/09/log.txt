I've decided to expand the web site...;
by adding 2 further separate folder sections:

[Personal]
[Programming]

-----

Each separate folder...index.html page...
has it's own 'unique' menu/file list:

[Personal], cv.html(x), home.html, personal.html, profile.html(x)
[Programming], dos.html, programming.html, index.html

NOTE: The (x) just simply means that page hasn't been created, yet;
but, I'm definitely thinking about adding it, in future.

-----

Each individual page inside of the sub-folder(s) has, at least, 3 links...

pagename.html, linking to the content page itself: (blog.html)
sub-folder-name.html, linking back to the sub-folder main subject: (personal.html)
home, linking back to the main homepage: (../index.html)

-----

Decided to include another sitewide change...
All navigation links to be lower case...to start out;
then, later on...when a link is 'selected' it's case changes to become
all UPPERCASE characters, instead;
this change being applied by using a CSS stylesheet.
