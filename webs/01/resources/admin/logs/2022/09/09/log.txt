I've decided to expand the web site...;
by adding 2 further separate folder sections:

[Personal]
[Programming]

-----

Each separate folder...index.html page...
has it's own 'unique' menu/file list:

[Personal], cv.html(x), home.html, personal.html, profile.html(x)
[Programming], dos.html, programming.html, index.html

NOTE: The (x) just simply means that page hasn't been created, yet;
but, I'm definitely thinking about adding it, in future.

-----

Each sub-folder has, at least, 3 links...

pagename.html, linking to the page itself
home, linking to the main homepage
sub-folder name, linking to the sub-folder index.html page.
