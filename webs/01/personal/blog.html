     <span class="clsDateTimeStamp">Thu 080922 08:20 AM GMT</span> - Woke up feeling extremely tired...all because I went to sleep 'late'...;
     need to get some more sleep in really rather desperately. However, I do have a very important appointment to attend, at the moment;
     having to go 'sign on' at Streatham Job centre; and, therefore, getting in some more sleep is completely out of the question, I'm afraid.
     Appointment, first; then, 'think' about getting some more sleep in much later on...!
    </p>

    <p class="clsPara">
     Today, I went and looked inside of the fridge...where I saw 4 lemons being stored inside of an upopened mesh bag.
     I decided to tear open the mesh bag; take out one of the lemons...slice it in half; then, squeeze that half into a pint of boiling water...;
     finally, I added a spoonful of honey to taste. Wow, this drink tasted really lovely and 'fresh'. I think, it's far better doing it yourself;
     than, buying lemon syrrup from down at the local supermarket.
    </p>

    <p class="clsPara">
     I also made 2 x phone calls: 1 to my cousin, Sharon/and, another to my other cousin, Millicent.
     I basically explained to them all about what's going on in my life at the moment...problems with the door/my left arm fell off bike accident/-etc.
     <br><br>
     I forgot to mention the roof is leaking...all the way down into the bedroom...which is making the bed mattress wet.
     I'm going to have to move the bed around, I think.
