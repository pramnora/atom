      Woke up feeling extremely tired...all because I went to sleep 'late'...at around 2 AM morning;
      couldn't help feeling that I needed to get some more sleep in, and, really rather desperately.
      However, I do have a very important appointment to attend, at the moment;
      having to go 'sign on' at Streatham Job centre 9.55 AM; and, therefore, getting in some more sleep is completely out of the question, I'm afraid.
      Appointment, first; then, 'think' about getting some more sleep in much later on...!
     </p>

     <p class="clsPara">
      <span class="clsDateTimeStamp">10:00 AM GMT</span> -
      Walked over to Streatham Job Center; and, 'signed on'.
      <br><br>
      Came out of Steatham Job Center...; and, decided to do some shopping at Aldi.; just at the top corner.
      <br><br>
      Brought lots of tinned food: 20 x tins of sardines/10 x tins of tomatoes/4 x tins of franfurter sausages/3 x tins of baked beans & sausages/
      plus, 1 tin coconut milk; also, I brought: 1 x pack of pasta/1 x brown rice/1 jar of beetroot slices/-etc.
      <br><br>
      It was difficult attempting to carry the whole lot home...dividing the shopping up into being 4 bags...using my hands/(with my left arm being ill);
      however, I did eventually manage to make it home.
     </p>

      I went and looked inside of the fridge...where I saw 4 lemons being stored inside of an upopened mesh bag.
      I used the fingers of both hands to tear open the mesh bag; take out one of the lemons...slice it in half;
      then, squeeze that half into a pint of boiling water...;
      finally, I added a spoonful of honey to taste. Wow, this drink tasted really lovely and 'fresh'. I think, it's far better 'doing it yourself';
      than, buying lemon syrrup from down at the local supermarket.
     </p>

      <span class="clsDateTimeStamp">14:00 PM GMT</span> -
      I also made 2 x phone calls: 1 to my cousin, Sharon/and, another to my other cousin, Millicent.
      I basically explained to them all about what's going on in my life at the moment...problems with the door not closing, properly/
       my left arm is still, serioulsy, hurting...after falling off my bike, accident in the street/-etc.
      <br><br>
      -(I forgot to mention the roof is leaking...as I didn't wish to tell them too much...; because, it sounds like I'm constantly <i>complaining</i>...!)-

      I decided to go and visit William Hill Poker site.
       Where I went and deposited £5.00...as usual, it lost!
      I did have some winnings left...; which rather than withdraw...I continued to use to gamble with...
      until when all of the money had completely ran out;
      thus, leaving me with an absolutely nil balance; and, at that point in time, I had no other choice left but to quit;
      after all, what's the point of depositing more funds into gambling...when you are, most likely, to loose it all;
      and, especially, when my bank a/c funds are so exremely low...?!
     </p>

      <span class="clsDateTimeStamp">20:00 PM GMT</span> -
      I heard it on the news that the Queen of England had died at age 96.
      Truly, very sad to see her go...; as I kind of liked seeing her a lot on TV, actually.
      Unfortunately, I won't be able to see her ever, again...that is, in 'real life'; but, only in photos/or, movie recordings.
     </p>

     <p class="clsPara">
      <span class="clsDateTimeStamp">21:30 PM GMT</span> -
      I went down the road...originally, with the intention to go and visit the local
      CoOp supermarket store...to buy some bread/and, possibly, bananas;
      and, for these reasons, I'd taken a spare £5.00 note along with me to go and spend.
      <br><br>
      But, as soon as I walked down the main road -(my bike no longer works), I saw the Fish 'n' Chips shop;
      so, decided to go in there...; asked the man behind the counter how much for chips? Answer: £2.50;
      I thought to myself I haven't had chips in ages...like must be over 6 months long...;
      normally, when I have money I would buy chips inside there a lot more regularly; so, the man behind the counter knows me well.
       <br><br>
     -(In actual fact, we both went to Norwood Park Primary school together; his name as I remember it is, George;
      but, I also heard people call him, Gary, for some wierd reason...I just didn't bother to ask?).-
      <br><br>
      I handed over the fiver I had...; and, ordered some chips for £2.50. Next, I inquired how much is a Steak & Kidney pie?
      He answered me, £2.90. So, immediately, I shook my head...; as I had only taken £5.00 with me in cash.
      <br><br>
      The guy on noticing my obvious disappointment...said if I didn't have enough change; he would give me the Steak and Kidney pie, anyway;
      so long as I remembered to bring him the extra 0.40p cash whenever I have it. I heartily thanked him.
      -(NOTE: I have had quite a few occassions when I walked in there...without sufficient change; and, did promise to pay him back, later;
      so, he knows trusting me pretty much a sure thing.)
      <br><br>
      Most unusually for me, I decided to eat both the chips/and, Steak and Kidney pie...while continuing to walk along the street.

      I walked down to CoOp supermarket store.
      In there I brought 2 loafs of brown bread @ 0.95p each/a bag of 4 x chocolate ball doughnuts @ £1.00/and,
      a box of Cadbury's mini chocolates...I'm not too sure what the price of that was...; but, I picked it up off the discount shelf.
      <br><br>
      All the time, I thought about getting some cat food...; which I usually buy for £6.00 at a time, 12 x packets;
      but, then, I thought to myself my bank a/c is pretty much totally flat broke by now; so, I think, I'll just stop doing any more shopping.
      <br><br>
      I walked off home...; the chips was gone...; I placed the rolled up chips paper inside of the public dustbin;
      and, then, next proceeded to eat the Steak and Kidney pie. By the time, I was half way up my road...everything was all done.

      It was a very difficult night...; where I could hardly sleep...; becuase it was raining down outside really rather heavily.
      <br><br>
      The problem being that the upstairs roof is leaking...; and, the water leaks down into the bedroom...;
      with rain water falling onto the bed; and, constantly, splashing me where I'm sleeping.
       <br><br>
      Going to have to re-position the bed somewhere I can avoid the leaks.
      <br><br>
      However, that doesn't fix certain other problems...
      <br><br>
      1> The roof needs fixing; (but, I don't have enough money...?)
      <br>
      2> The constant drip drip noise of the rain coming down through the ceiling.
      <br>
      3> Having to go place buckets to go catch up all the rain water/then, having to get up and empty these, regularly;
      before the buckets get too full.
      4> By far the worse worry I have is that the ceiling will eventually collapse, completely; as, already, i can see holes inside there.
