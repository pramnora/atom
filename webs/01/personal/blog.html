     Woke up feeling extremely tired...all because I went to sleep 'late'...at around 2 AM morning;
     couldn't help feeling that I needed to get some more sleep in, and, really rather desperately. However, I do have a very important appointment to attend, at the moment;
     having to go 'sign on' at Streatham Job centre 9.55 AM; and, therefore, getting in some more sleep is completely out of the question, I'm afraid.
     Appointment, first; then, 'think' about getting some more sleep in much later on...!

     I went and looked inside of the fridge...where I saw 4 lemons being stored inside of an upopened mesh bag.
     I decided to tear open the mesh bag; take out one of the lemons...slice it in half; then, squeeze that half into a pint of boiling water...;
     finally, I added a spoonful of honey to taste. Wow, this drink tasted really lovely and 'fresh'. I think, it's far better doing it yourself;
     than, buying lemon syrrup from down at the local supermarket.

     I also made 2 x phone calls: 1 to my cousin, Sharon/and, another to my other cousin, Millicent.
     I basically explained to them all about what's going on in my life at the moment...problems with the door/my left arm is still hurting
     after falling off my bike accident in the street/-etc.
     <br><br>
     -(I forgot to mention the roof is leaking...all the way down into the bedroom...which is making the bed mattress wet.
      I'm going to have to move the bed around a different way, in order to avoid the upstairs leak, constantly, wetting the downstairs mattress.
      Something has to be done in order to fix the roof...; but, frankly, at the moment, I just can't afford it...?!)-

     I decided to go and visit William Hill Poker site.
     Where I went and deposited £5.00...it lost. I went and deposted another £5.00 there...in the hope of winning back all that I had lost..
     which resulted in another £5.00 lost. At that point, I thought to myself...I could have used that money to buy some food, instead; so, I quit.

     I heard it on the news that the Queen of England had died at age 96.
     Truly, very sad to see her go...; as I kind of liked seeing her a lot, actually. Unfortunately, I won't be seeing her ever, again;
     that is, in 'real life'...; but, only in photos/or, movie recordings.

     I went down the road...originally, with the intention to go and visit the local
     CoOp supermarket store...to buy some bread/and, possibly, bananas. I'd taken a spare £5.00 note to spend.
     <br><br>
     But, as soon as I walked down the main road -(my bike no longer works), I saw the Fish 'n' Chips shop;
     so, decided to go in there...; asked the man behind the counter how much for chips? Answer: £2.50;
     I thought to myself I haven't had chips in ages...like must be over 6 months long...;
     normally, when I have money I would buy chips inside there a lot more regularly; so, the man behind the counter knows me well.
     <br><br>
     -(In actual fact, we both went to Norwood Park Primary school together; his name as I remember it is, George;
     but, I also heard people call him, Gary, for some wierd reason...I just didn't bother to ask?).-
     <br><br>
     I handed over the fiver I had...; and, ordered some chips for £2.50. Next, I inquired how much is a Steak & Kidney pie?
     He answered me, £2.90. So, immediately, I shook my head...; as I had only taken £5.00 with me in cash.
     <br><br>
     The guy on noticing my obvious disappointment...said if I didn't have enough change; he would give me the Steak and Kidney pie, anyway;
     so long as I remembered to bring him the extra 0.40p cash whenever I have it. I heartily thanked him.
     -(NOTE: I have had quite a few occassions when I walked in there...without sufficient change; and, did promise to pay him back, later;
      so, he knows trusting me pretty much a sure thing.)
     <br><br>
     Most unusually for me, I decided to eat both the chips/and, Steak and Kidney pie...while continuing to walk along the street.

     I walked down to CoOp supermarket store.
     In there I brought 2 loafs of brown bread @ 0.95p each/a bag of 4 x chocolate ball doughnuts @ £1.00/and,
     a box of Cadbury's mini chocolates...I'm not too sure what the price of that was...; but, I picked it up off the discount shelf.
     <br><br>
     All the time, I thought about getting some cat food...; which I usually buy for £6.00 at a time, 12 x packets;
     but, then, I thought to myself my bank a/c is pretty much totally flat broke by now; so, I think, I'll just stop doing any more shopping.
     <br><br>
     I walked off home...; the chips was gone...; I placed the rolled up chips paper inside of the public dustbin;
     and, then, next proceeded to eat the Steak and Kidney pie. By the time, I was half way up my road...everything was all done.
