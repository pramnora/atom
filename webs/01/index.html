   <h2>Introduction</h2>
   <p>
    The time over here in London, UK is 1:50 PM GMT; and, being the regular night owl that I am...I'm still sitting here typing away at the computer...just like I've been doing all morning long. ;-)
   </p>
   <p>
    Frankly, the life of the <i>computer programmer</i> is nowhere near as <i>glamourous</i> as it sounds; well, not unless you are getting really well paid to do such a job.
   </p>
   <p>
    But, I'm <i>unemployed</i>, so nobody is paying me absolutely anything. Instead, I'm just working away at learning it for FREE...; in the vain hope that one day, who knows, maybe, somebody will be willing to employ me either sooner or later...?
   </p>
   <hr width="50%">
   <p>
    Dear God, it's a horrible thing being left totally flat broke...; far more so than I do truly have words to be able to explain...?!
   </p>
   <p>
    Got this bill to pay/that bill to pay...; and, no f-ing money to be able to pay it with...; but, the bills themselves don't care...; like flies attracted to waste food...they just keep on pouring in like whole armies ready to attack.
   </p>
   <p>
    Every day, I wake up and think to myself...what the f*** am I going to do...?! And, frankly, there's no clear answer...; all of my savings just going, going, pretty soon...all gone! Then, what...??? OOOOHHHH SHIIIIIITTTTTT!!! I seem to have got my food stuck right in it...; and, cannot pull it out.
   </p>
   <p>
    I try my best to keep thinking <i>positive</i>...; but, man, when you are in the deep doo doo...; it's really hard too keep on looking real sweet like a piece of candy...when deep down inside you feel about as bitter as sheer hell.
   </p>
   <p>
    It's really very little comfort to me to realise we are living in a <b>depressed</b> economy; and, therefore, I can hardly claim to be suffering all alone. However, the honest truth is...it's your own pain which you do most tend to feel/whereas other people's pain is just mere theory...in direct comparison to your own.
   </p>
   <p>
    Furthermore, if it was only 'one' problem I got...; then, maybe, I wouldn't mind; but, no, I  got just far too many. Financial problems/mental health problems/physical health problems. The truth is I suffer from morning through till night, non-stop; even when I go to sleep...it's mostly all just nightmares...where things seem to go from bad to worse; I guess, if you are sitting around endlessly worrying all day/night long...then, at night some of those fears are still going to haunt your dreams. Worries and fears, that you just can't ever seem to escape from...???
   </p>
   <hr width="50%">
   <p>
     I can hardly look after myself...; living on bread and butter/and, water. How in the hell am I going to look after the cat...? I certainly don't want to give her up...; as she's the only company/friend I got left in the whole wide world; but,...?!
