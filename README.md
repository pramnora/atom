Just testing out how it's possible to both:  

a> 'push' files into GitHub  
b> 'fetch' files from GitHub  

...by using Atom code editor having been installed on a home based Desktop Computer PC which is running Windows 10 Pro OS/Operating System.

**NOTES**: 

**NOTE(1)**: It's possible to work both inside of Windows Explorer/and, inside of Atom code editor;  
and, any changes you make to either the directory/file structure will be reflected inside of Atom, instantly, right away.
